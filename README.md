# Autonomous_Vacuum_Cleaner
An Autonomous Vacuum cleaning robot that can be used to clean Dust in your Household.

### Introduction:
Automation today has become the core of every other field. Who wants to do work themselves? No one right. Therefore, making your work easier, here we are with an Autonomous Vacuum Cleaning Robot which will Navigate through your House avoiding Obstacles and cleaning the area under it. This project will guide you to make an Autonomous Vacuum Rover, thereby known, the AVR.

## Instructions

This is the cumulative code made for the final working model of the Vacuum Cleaner

This is basic code for any Arduino UNO or MEGA board

The motor driver used is an L298 with 2*5V DC Motors

Ultrasonic Sensors used are HC-SR04

The Vacuum we made was made using a 5V DC Motor in a Pipe such that it creates a suction

For the dust collection, we used a Bag Attached to the back of the Pipe

#### NOTE
This was my Project for the First Year of my Engineering College in the Field of Robotics and Automation
This helped me grasp basic concepts of Arduino and Electronics along with multiple Mechanical Concepts and basic Embedded C Coding
